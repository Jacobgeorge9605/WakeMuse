### Project Description
We are dedigned a motivational alaram in which the alaram rings every day respective time that is set by the user, once the user snooze it, the motivational tone will be played 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
for humans, the entire day begins with what mood he is on the morning. the mood of the day mostly determined by the specific thing they hears or do daily.
we proposing a motivational alarm that rings based on set by user when the day before he slept

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Motivational alarm and task setting is the feature and main thing about our project, this method help the human to stay positively and remainds him how many task he has to do on particular that day.
so that he stay positive the entire day 


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
1. Programming Language: Java (for Android app development)
2. Development Environment: Android Studio (IDE for designing and building Android apps)
3. Libraries and Frameworks:
    AndroidX Core: For compatibility features like NotificationCompat.
    WorkManager: For scheduling recurring tasks such as daily alarms.
    MediaPlayer: For playing alarm tones and motivational audio.
    AudioManager: For managing audio streams (e.g., alarms).
4. System Components:
    AlarmManager: For scheduling precise alarms and wake-up triggers.
    BroadcastReceiver: To respond to alarm triggers and initiate app                           actions.
    Notification Channels: For managing and displaying notifications.
5. Testing and Debugging:
    Android Emulator for testing app behavior.
    Logcat for debugging and monitoring app activities.

   
### Implementation

We propose an innovative alarm application built using Java and Firebase that dynamically generates motivational tones to provide a positive start to the day. Users can set alarms for the next day, with each alarm playing a unique tone fetched from Firebase Storage. The app also allows users to set and save daily tasks in Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database, ensuring their goals are easily accessible. By combining dynamic audio playback with personalized task management, the app delivers an inspiring and productive morning routine while leveraging Firebase for reliable backend support.
